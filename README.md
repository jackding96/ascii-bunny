## Things that came up
1. Finding a good multi-language unicode library was surprisingly difficult

## Things to do
1. Non-monospace characters? Is this possible without using canvas?
2. Markup editor formatting?
3. Copy button
4. Slider for padding: top, bottom, left, right!
5. Max-width, max-height, max-characters settings
